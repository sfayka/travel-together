# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Collaborative Notes System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality for users to add comments and notes to activities, enabling collaboration between trip participants.
# Details:
1. Create database schema for Notes model with fields: id, activity_id, user_id, content, created_at
2. Implement API routes for notes operations:
   - GET/POST /api/activities/[activity_id]/notes
   - DELETE /api/notes/[note_id]
3. Build note creation interface within activity detail view
4. Create notes listing component showing user avatar, name, timestamp, and content
5. Implement note deletion functionality
6. Add real-time updates using Supabase real-time subscriptions
7. Style all note-related components

# Test Strategy:
Test adding notes to activities and verify they appear in the UI. Test note deletion. Verify real-time updates work when another user adds a note. Test with multiple users to ensure collaborative functionality works as expected.
