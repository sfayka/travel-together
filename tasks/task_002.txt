# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create authentication flows for user signup, login, and profile management using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
1. Implement sign-up page with email/password fields
2. Create login page with form validation
3. Set up authentication context/provider for global auth state
4. Add protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users
5. Create minimal user profile setup (name, email)
6. Implement session persistence and token refresh
7. Add logout functionality

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration with valid and invalid inputs. Verify login works with correct credentials and fails with incorrect ones. Confirm protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login page. Test session persistence across page refreshes.
