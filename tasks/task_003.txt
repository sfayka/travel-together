# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Trip Management CRUD
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement core functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting trips with essential details.
# Details:
1. Create database schema for Trip model with fields: id, name, destination, start_date, end_date, user_id, created_at
2. Implement API routes for trip CRUD operations:
   - GET/POST /api/trips
   - GET/PUT/DELETE /api/trips/[id]
3. Build trip creation form with validation
4. Create trip listing page (dashboard) showing all user trips
5. Implement trip detail view page
6. Add trip edit and delete functionality
7. Style all trip-related components

# Test Strategy:
Test creating trips with valid and invalid data. Verify trips appear in the dashboard after creation. Test editing trip details and confirm changes persist. Verify trip deletion removes the trip from the database and UI.
