# Description: Create functionality for tracking and managing trip expenses and budgets.
# Details:
1. Create database schema for BudgetItem model with fields: id, trip_id, category, description, amount, currency, created_at
2. Implement API routes for budget operations:
   - GET/POST /api/trips/[trip_id]/budget
   - PUT/DELETE /api/budget/[budget_item_id]
3. Build budget creation form with amount, category, and description
4. Create budget summary view showing total planned expenses by category
5. Implement budget item listing with edit/delete functionality
