# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Basic Itinerary Export
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to export trip itineraries as PDF or plain text files for offline use.
# Details:
1. Install and configure PDF generation library (react-pdf or jsPDF)
2. Create API route for generating exports:
   - GET /api/trips/[trip_id]/export?format=pdf|txt
3. Design PDF template showing trip details and activities in chronological order
4. Implement plain text export format
5. Add download buttons to trip detail page
6. Include trip name, dates, activities, and basic notes in exports
7. Handle error cases gracefully

# Test Strategy:
Test PDF generation with various trip configurations (many/few activities, long/short descriptions). Verify PDF content matches trip data. Test text export format. Verify downloads work correctly in different browsers.
